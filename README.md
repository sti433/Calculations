🧮 Calculations Project (C# Console Application)

The Calculations project is a practical and lightweight application written in C#.
This repository contains the complete source code used to perform various computational operations.

📋 About the Project

This project is built as a Console Application, keeping the structure simple and efficient.
The main logic of the program is located in the Program(2).cs file, where the core algorithms and calculation functions are implemented.

It is designed to demonstrate how different computational tasks can be executed cleanly within a C# console environment.
